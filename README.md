# Skeleton

This is our boilerplate theme for all internal projects at Old Town Media. It's simple, easy, and easily modifiable. Use it in your own themes or fork it and modify it how you please!

## Why We Built Our Own Skeleton

We built this theme because we needed a framework that closely matched our normal designs and workflow. We have built this bare bones skeleton of a theme out as an easily modifiable boilerplate to base all of our themes off of. It uses a common set of classes, functions, and scripts.

## How to Use

Clone the repo out and pull the contents into your themes folder. Rename the folder and wildcards spread throughout the files and modify to your pleasing!
